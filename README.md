- **Puppeteer**: Headless browser automation for capturing screenshots
- **GitHub Actions**: Scheduled automation every 24 hours
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the capture script

### 📋 Process
1. **Daily Trigger**: GitHub Actions runs at midnight UTC
2. **Smart Capture**: Script intelligently locates the "Idea of the Day" section
3. **Archive Storage**: Saves screenshot with human-readable filename
4. **Auto-Commit**: Pushes new capture to repository

### 🎯 Content Detection
The script uses multiple methods to locate content:
- CSS selectors for known page elements
- Text-based content detection
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability
